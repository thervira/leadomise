Getting Started with LEADOMISE FRAGMENTER TOOL
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Introduction
************

To generate fragments LEADOMISE - Fragmenter Tool is using BRICS method [#f1]_, 
which is implemented in RDKit: (https://www.rdkit.org). 
The fragments can be uploaded to MySQL databse (https://www.mysql.com).


Setting Up Fragmentation
************************

User can either fragment the input molecule(s) with default settings or 
can use advanced settings to define the rules of fragmentation process. 
The second way allows to create customized fragment sets with variety of 
sizes and properties. 

Optionally, the output fragments can be further added to MySQL database.

Simple Fragmentation
====================

Molecules can be fragmented by providing the input file in the 'Select Input File'
window and then pressing 'START' button. This uses the default settings for the 
output fragments.

Customized Fragmentation
========================

The generated fragments can vary in size (by changing the min Fragment Size) and 
multiple properties.
This include range of:
- molecular weight
- hydrogen bonds acceptors
- hydrogen bonds donors
- heavy atoms
- TPSA
- charge
- rotatable bonds
- clogP

Adding Fragments to Database
============================

The molecular fragments can be added automatically to the MySQL database if 
box 'add to database' is checked in. This assumes that the user provides
username and password to MySQL.  

The database 'fragments' and table 'fragments' is then created (if it does not exit
already) and all the fragments are uploaded to it. The whole database is also shown 
in 'Database Fragments' in results tab. Only molecules with unique SMILES are stored.

Search the Database
*******************

Both input fragments and database fragments can be searched to find similar structures. 
To do that, user should provide the SMILES and range of Similarity Tanimoto.

Analyzing the data
******************

User can analyze the generated fragments by plotting various properties. 
For now, line, scatter and histogram plots can be created. 

Histogram plot
==============

To plot histogram, select 'histogram' in 'plot type' box and change the number of bins (default: 10).

Choose the property for analysis only for X axis (e.g. molecular weight).

Check in either 'input fragments' or 'database fragments' depending which data you wish you plot and 
press 'Plot the Data'. 

The plot can be saved by clicking the save icon.

Scatter Plot
============
To make scatter plot, select 'scatter' in 'plot type' box.

Choose the property for analysis for both X and Y axis (e.g. molecular weight and heavy atoms).

Check in either 'input fragments' or 'database fragments' depending which data you wish you plot and 
press 'Plot the Data'. 

The plot can be saved by clicking the save icon.

Line Plot
=========
To make line plot, select 'line' in 'plot type' box.

Choose the property for analysis for both X and Y axis (e.g. molecular weight and heavy atoms).

Check in either 'input fragments' or 'database fragments' depending which data you wish you plot and 
press 'Plot the Data'. 

The plot can be saved by clicking the save icon. 


Saving the data
***************

User can save generated input or database fragments either in SDF or CSV format.

Save Input File Fragments
=========================

This allows to save the fragments generated from the input file provided by user.

In order to do that, select File>Save Input Fragments As> and then choose either SDF or CSV format.

Save Database Fragments
=======================

This allows to save the fragments stored in the database.

In order to do that, select File>Save Database Fragments As> and then choose either SDF or CSV format.
